## Introduction

This repository includes code and projects that I’ve developed while learning Python. The journey covers various aspects, from fundamental programming concepts to sophisticated AI/ML models. 

## Learning Resources

Here are some of the resources that I used to learn Python:

- **Books**: 
  - "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes
  - "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet

- **Online Courses**:
  - [Coursera Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
  - [Udacity AI for Trading](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-trading--ud501)

- **Documentation**:
  - [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
  - [Scikit-Learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)

## Projects

### Basics

1. **Calculator App**  
   A simple calculator application using Python. 

2. **Basic Data Analysis**  
   Simple data analysis and visualization projects using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

### Intermediate
